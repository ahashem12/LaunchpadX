# Launchpad X (LPX)

**Empowering MENA's Builders Through Decentralized Venture Infrastructure**

Launchpad X (LPX) is a smart contract-based platform that helps social impact founders across the MENA region launch tokenized ventures with built-in governance, funding, and trust. Our goal is to bridge the $300B regional funding gap by creating legal, transparent, and community-governed alternatives to traditional venture building.

> "No proof, no opportunity" — LPX fixes that by giving MENA builders access to the infrastructure they need.

## 🌍 What It Solves

- 🚫 **Lack of legal & financial infrastructure** for early-stage founders
- 🔁 **Cycle of failure**: No funding → No team → No venture → No impact
- ❌ **Broken trust** between funders and entrepreneurs

---

## 🔧 How LPX Works

A 3-step process for building real-world, tokenized impact ventures:

1. **Onboard**: Founders and contributors join the LPX platform.
2. **Co-build**: Tokenized skill contributions are logged and tracked transparently.
3. **Tokenize**: Projects launch with DAO governance and milestone-based distribution.

The system uses smart contracts on Polygon to manage:
- DAO voting
- Skill-based staking
- Reputation layers (SBTs)
- Milestone validation

## 🚀 MVP Features (Current Version)

- ✅ Project creation UI
